# HTMLtoCode jQuery Plugin

## What does it do?

This plugin allows to show the code used to create a piece of html, which helps when building documentation pages.

Instead of having to duplicate code to show both the rendered html and its source, simply wrap it with an element, set its class (which you can define) and let HTMLtoCode to do the rest.
